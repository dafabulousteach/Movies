Hello and Welcome!

My name is Kim Merino and I am budding developer. I taught myself Python and this project I created is a webpage that shows my favorite movies. Click on the movie poster and the trailer will play in another window.

In your terminal, type:

Python entertainment_center.py 

and watch what happens!
